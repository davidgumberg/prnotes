### `m_last_block_processed*`

`class Wallet` has two private members guarded by `RecursiveMutex cs_wallet`
that keep track of the wallet's last processed block from the chain:

```cpp
    /**
     * The following is used to keep track of how far behind the wallet is
     * from the chain sync, and to allow clients to block on us being caught up.
     *
     * Processed hash is a pointer on node's tip and doesn't imply that the wallet
     * has scanned sequentially all blocks up to this one.
     */
    uint256 m_last_block_processed GUARDED_BY(cs_wallet);

    /** Height of last block processed is used by wallet to know depth of transactions
     * without relying on Chain interface beyond asynchronous updates. For safety, we
     * initialize it to -1. Height is a pointer on node's tip and doesn't imply
     * that the wallet has scanned sequentially all blocks up to this one.
     */
    int m_last_block_processed_height GUARDED_BY(cs_wallet) = -1;
```

Ostensibly, `m_last_block_processed` stores the block hash of the last block
processed, and `m_last_block_processed_height` the height of the last block
processed.

They can be retrieved by value with the following getters:

```cpp
    /** Get last block processed height */
    int GetLastBlockHeight() const EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_wallet)
    {
        AssertLockHeld(cs_wallet);
        assert(m_last_block_processed_height >= 0);
        return m_last_block_processed_height;
    };
    uint256 GetLastBlockHash() const EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_wallet)
    {
        AssertLockHeld(cs_wallet);
        assert(m_last_block_processed_height >= 0);
        return m_last_block_processed;
    }
```

and set with `CWallet::SetLastBlockProcessed()` (which is only used in unit tests):

```cpp
/** Set last block processed height, currently only use in unit test */
void SetLastBlockProcessed(int block_height, uint256 block_hash) EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_wallet)
{
    AssertLockHeld(cs_wallet);
    m_last_block_processed_height = block_height;
    m_last_block_processed = block_hash;
};
```

#### Direct users of `m_last_block_processed_*`

`CWallet::BackupWallet()` is used by the `backupwallet` and `migratewallet`
rpc's, to back up a wallet db to a file. Most of the legwork is handled by `WalletDatabase::Backup()` (or some implementation of it e.g. `SQliteDatabase::Backup()`), but before being handed off `CWallet` makes sure that the best block's locator record is written to the DB: 

```cpp
bool CWallet::BackupWallet(const std::string& strDest) const
{
    if (m_chain) {
        CBlockLocator loc;
        // [ Find the block with our `m_last_block_processed`'s hash in the
        //    node's chainstate (m_chain) and get it's CBlockLocator.]
        WITH_LOCK(cs_wallet, chain().findBlock(m_last_block_processed, FoundBlock().locator(loc)));
        // [ Only if locator is non-null.. ]
        if (!loc.IsNull()) {
            // [ Get a batch for writing to this wallet's m_database object ]
            WalletBatch batch(GetDatabase());
            // [ WriteBestBlock will just write the serialized locator value to
            //   the key DBKeys::BESTBLOCK_NOMERKLE in the wallet db. ]
            batch.WriteBestBlock(loc);
        }
    }
    // [ WalletDatabase::Backup() does the rest of the work... ]
    return GetDatabase().Backup(strDest);
}
```

----

`CWallet::AttachChain()` which is invoked when a wallet is created
(`CWallet::Create()`) will set the wallet's last block values to the node's
chaintip values at the time of wallet creation:

```cpp
bool CWallet::AttachChain(const std::shared_ptr<CWallet>& walletInstance, interfaces::Chain& chain, const bool rescan_required, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings)
{
    // [...]
    const std::optional<int> tip_height = chain.getHeight();
    if (tip_height) {
        walletInstance->m_last_block_processed = chain.getBlockHash(*tip_height);
        walletInstance->m_last_block_processed_height = *tip_height;
    } else {
        walletInstance->m_last_block_processed.SetNull();
        walletInstance->m_last_block_processed_height = -1;
    }
    // [...]
}
```

----

`CWallet::BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain()` is used in what seems to be all wallet rpc's to: "Make sure the results are valid at least up to the most recent block the user could have gotten from another RPC command prior to now":

```cpp
void CWallet::BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain() const {
    // [ A lock on cs_wallet going into this function could result in deadlock. ]
    AssertLockNotHeld(cs_wallet);

    // [ This outdated comment below describes logic that once was here, and has has
    //  now been moved to waitForNotificationsIfTipChanged()]
    // Skip the queue-draining stuff if we know we're caught up with
    // chain().Tip(), otherwise put a callback in the validation interface queue and wait
    // for the queue to drain enough to execute it (indicating we are caught up
    // at least with the time we entered this function).

    // [ WITH_LOCK executes the second argument as a lambda with the first
    //   argument prefaced by LOCK()ing the first arg. ]
    uint256 last_block_hash = WITH_LOCK(cs_wallet, return m_last_block_processed);

    // [ no-op if `last_block_hash` == chainstate tip, otherwise forces
    //   execution of validation signal queue.
    //   (ValidationSignals::SyncWithValidationInterfaceQueue ]
    chain().waitForNotificationsIfTipChanged(last_block_hash);
}
```

They are also modified in the `CWallet::blockConnected()` and
`CWallet::blockDisconnected()` callbacks:

```cpp
void CWallet::blockConnected(ChainstateRole role, const interfaces::BlockInfo& block)
{
    // [...]
    m_last_block_processed_height = block.height;
    m_last_block_processed = block.hash;
    // [...]
}

void CWallet::blockDisconnected(const interfaces::BlockInfo& block)
{
    // [...]
    m_last_block_processed_height = block.height - 1;
    m_last_block_processed = *Assert(block.prev_hash);
    // [...]
}
```

I'll look at those in more detail below.


### `CWallet::blockConnected()`

Here is the description from `CValidationInterface` of the `BlockConnected`
callback:

```cpp

// [ src/validationinterface.h ]
class CValidationInterface {
protected:
    /**
     * Notifies listeners of a block being connected.
     * Provides a vector of transactions evicted from the mempool as a result.
     *
     * Called on a background thread.
     */
    virtual void BlockConnected(ChainstateRole role, const std::shared_ptr<const CBlock> &block, const CBlockIndex *pindex) {}
};
```

Params `block` and `pindex` get passed to `kernel::MakeBlockInfo()` (üòÆ‚Äçüí®) which makes a `struct node::interfaces::BlockInfo`, before passing to `CWallet`'s callback.

<details>


<summary>

`struct BlockInfo`

</summary>


```cpp
//! Block data sent with blockConnected, blockDisconnected notifications.
struct BlockInfo {
    const uint256& hash;
    // [ Raw pointers are used here for members that are optional. ]
    const uint256* prev_hash = nullptr;
    int height = -1;
    int file_number = -1;
    unsigned data_pos = 0;
    const CBlock* data = nullptr;
    const CBlockUndo* undo_data = nullptr;
    // The maximum time in the chain up to and including this block.
    // A timestamp that can only move forward.
    unsigned int chain_time_max{0};

    // [ Can be constructed from a hash. ]
    BlockInfo(const uint256& hash LIFETIMEBOUND) : hash(hash) {}
};
```

</details>


```cpp
void CWallet::blockConnected(ChainstateRole role, const interfaces::BlockInfo& block)
{
    // [ assumeutxo background validation, doesn't affect best block. ]
    if (role == ChainstateRole::BACKGROUND) {
        return;
    }
    // [ Q: It makes sense that we expect block.data == true, but why enforce
    //   with an assert? ]
    assert(block.data);
    LOCK(cs_wallet);

    m_last_block_processed_height = block.height;
    m_last_block_processed = block.hash;


    // [ The below performance optimization was added in: #27469
    //   (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27469) ]

    // No need to scan block if it was created before the wallet birthday.
    // Uses chain max time and twice the grace period to adjust time for block time variability.
    if (block.chain_time_max < m_birth_time.load() - (TIMESTAMP_WINDOW * 2)) return;

    // Scan block
    for (size_t index = 0; index < block.data->vtx.size(); index++) {
        SyncTransaction(block.data->vtx[index], TxStateConfirmed{block.hash, block.height, static_cast<int>(index)});
        transactionRemovedFromMempool(block.data->vtx[index], MemPoolRemovalReason::BLOCK);
    }
}
```

## Problem

The problem is that the `CWallet::chainStateFlushed()` callback updates the
best block record in the wallet db to the locator that the flush passes, even if
the wallet hasn't necessarily processed up to that block, or if that block isn't
the latest, and it doesn't update the `m_last_block_processed*` members,
allowing them to fall out of sync with the db.:

```cpp
void CWallet::chainStateFlushed(ChainstateRole role, const CBlockLocator& loc)
    // Don't update the best block until the chain is attached so that in case of a shutdown,
    // the rescan will be restarted at next startup.
    if (m_attaching_chain || role == ChainstateRole::BACKGROUND) {
        return;
    }
    // [ Write the best block to the locator we received, even though we haven't
    //   necessarily processed the txn's in this block. ]
    WalletBatch batch(GetDatabase());
    batch.WriteBestBlock(loc);
}
