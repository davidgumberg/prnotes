# [#28016](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28016/) p2p: gives seednode priority over dnsseed if both are provided
_All comments in `[]` are my own._

## Gives seednode priority over dnsseed if both are provided 

Modifies `CConman::ThreadDNSAddressSeed()` which is called during `CConman::Start` and
handles (all?) of the logic for communicating with DNS seeders.

### `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` Prior to #28016:

- Shuffles all of our hard-coded DNS seeds. (`vSeeds` in chainparams.cpp)
- Uses `seeds_right_now` to represent the number of seeds we should connect to before
  checking if we have enough connections.
    - If the cli argument `-forcednsseed` is set, or if we have 0 peers in our `addrman`,
      we contact every single DNS seed we know:
      ```cpp
      seeds_right_now = seeds.size
      ```
- Uses `seeds_wait_time` to represent the amount of time we should wait before contacting
  DNS seeds. If our addrman is healthy (>= 1000 peers in it) then we will wait for 5
  minutes before contacting them, otherwise we wait 11 seconds. (As of March 2024):
```cpp
int seeds_right_now = 0;
if (gArgs.GetBoolArg("-forcednsseed", DEFAULT_FORCEDNSSEED)) {
    seeds_right_now = seeds.size();
} else if (addrman.Size() == 0) {
    seeds_right_now = seeds.size();
}
```

- Loop through each `seed` of our `seeds`
    - If `seeds_right_now` is still `0`, (the two conditions mentioned above were not
      satisfied) then set `seeds_right_now = 3` (Why?)
        - Added in [#15558](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15558)
        > Before this PR, when we don't have enough connections after 11 seconds, we
        > proceed to query all DNS seeds in a fixed order, loading responses from all of
        > them.

        > Change this to to only query three randomly-selected DNS seed. If 11 seconds
        > later we still don't have enough connections, try again with another one, and so
        > on.

        > This reduces the amount of information DNS seeds can observe about the
        > requesters by spreading the load over all of them.

        
    - If `addrman` is not empty, we need to wait out the `seeds_wait_time` set above:
        - While we are waiting, keep checking to see if we have 2 Full Outbound
          connections, if we ever do, we are done seeding, so `LogPrintf` and `return`.
    - Check if an `interruptNet` flag signaling that we need to close down shop for
      p2p services has been set. The same check exists in the loop above when we
      wait out `seeds_wait_time`.
    - Check if our p2p network is inactive (`if(!fNetworkActive)`) and if it is inactive,
      hang and check every second if (!fNetworkActive) before continuing.
    ```cpp
    if (!fNetworkActive) {
        LogPrintf("Waiting for network to be reactivated before querying DNS seeds.\n");
        do {
            if (!interruptNet.sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds{1})) return;
        } while (!fNetworkActive);
    }
    ```

    - Now that we have waited out `seed_wait_time`, and we know that we don't have enough
      full outbound connections, no one has asked us to shut down p2p services, and our
      p2p connection is active, let's start fetching addr's from our DNS seed.
    ```cpp
    LogPrintf("Loading addresses from DNS seed %s\n", seed);
    ```
    - If we have a SOCKS5 proxy, don't do a DNS lookup, just connect to the seed address
      directly as a `getaddr` connection.
    - Otherwise:
        - We represent the DNS seed as `CNetAddr resolveSource` with an `m_net =
          NET_INTERNAL`. `NET_INTERNAL` is a fake network type that stores the host
          strings it is given as hashes and is used specifically to represent the DNS seed
          which gave us a peer in our `addrman`            - Added in [#10446](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10446)
        - Use the C std library `getaddrinfo()` to do a DNS lookup of the seed, and store
          up to `nMaxIPs` of the records returned.
            - If this fails, just connect directly to the seed as a `getaddr connection
              instead.
        - Convert the `CNetAddr`'s to `CAddress`es which include port and service flag
          information about an address.
            - We assume the port is `m_params.GetDefaultPort()`. (8333)
            - I may be mistaken, but it seems we mistakenly assume the service flags are
              `SeedsServiceFlags() = ServiceFlags(NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS)` and use
              that for the `nServices` of the `CAddress`.
                - It is actually OK. At present the 'rules'
                  (`contrib/makeseeds.py`)` for seeds is that they should only
                  gossip the above Service Flags. We already store `nServices`
                  of gossiped (ADDR) peer addresses based on what the gossiping peer
                  tells us the service flags of an address are. We don't do
                  anything bad with this information, and if we did, peers could
                  lie about their service flags, we would have much bigger
                  problems.
            - Set the `CAddress`'s `nTime` to a random age between 3 and 24 hours.
                - Why?
        - Add the `CAddress` and information about which DNS seed gave us the `CAddress`
          to our `addrman`.
            - What happens with the source information? 
                > Once these checks have finished we will add all the addresses we were happy
                > with by calling AddrMan::Add() and passing the vector of good addresses in
                > along with metadata on who sent us this address in the form of a CNetAddr
                > (the source address). The source address is notably used later in Add() (by
                > AddrmanImpl::AddSingle()) to determine which new bucket this new address
                > should be placed into as an anti-sybil measure.
                From the [OBC Guide](https://obc.256k1.dev/#_addrman).
                
                After that, it's `Connman`'s responsibility to ensure connections come
                from a diversity of buckets.

### Changes
- Refactors to introduce and use`GetFullOutboundConnCount()`:
```cpp
// Return the number of outbound connections that are full relay (not blocks only)
int CConnman::GetFullOutboundConnCount() const
{
    int nRelevant = 0;
    {
        LOCK(m_nodes_mutex);
    for (const CNode* pnode : m_nodes) {
            if (pnode->fSuccessfullyConnected && pnode->IsFullOutboundConn()) ++nRelevant;
        }
    }
    return nRelevant;
}
```

instead of:
```cpp
int nRelevant = 0;
{
    LOCK(m_nodes_mutex);
    for (const CNode* pnode : m_nodes) {
        if (pnode->fSuccessfullyConnected && pnode->IsFullOutboundConn()) ++nRelevant;
    }
}
```

- At the beginning of `ThreadDNSAddressSeed()`, if `gArgs.IsArgSet("-seednode")`, we sleep
  this thread for 30 seconds, occassionally checking if we have gotten enough peers and
  exiting our sleep to `LogPrintf` and return if we have.

## Added seednode prioritization message to help output

This commit only modifies the `-seednode` help output, and does some light renaming and
movement of variables.

# Questions:

- Why does the `-forcednsseed` arg to `bitcoind` exist?

Added in [#4559](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4559)
Laanwj:
> I'm not sure [`-dnsseeddelay`]  is an parameter that makes much sense to customize.
> Usually you'll either want full control over bootstrapping (`-dnsseed=0`), use DNS seeds
> when needed after a 'sane' delay (the default), or force DNS seed usage immediately
> (`-forcednsseed`, main use case faster debugging/troubleshooting of DNS seeds code).

# Probability of seed node connection failures

Probability of failing to make a successful connection after 30 seconds and then falling back

- On Signet: 6/12 fell back to dns seeds
- On mainnet: 7/12 fell back to dns seeds


# Updates


## Force push: [78482a0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/78482a09e06beb841e70781eb509c2b2fdea8bd9)
- Makes the seed node timeout and the target outbound connections values `constexpr`'s.
