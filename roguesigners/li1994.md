# Notes on "Remark on the Threshold RSA Signature Scheme"

This paper demonstrates that Desmedt and Frankel's 1991 `(k, l)` threshold signature
scheme[^1], where a group secret `K` can be divided into `l` many shares, and the
group signature can be produced with `k`  many shares (`k <= l`), having the
following design goal:

    "The signing group holds the responsibility to the signed message. That is,
     each signer in this group cannot deny having signed the message."

is vulnerable to an attack where `>= k` conspiring members of the group `l` can
reveal the group secret of the scheme and consequently sign messages while
denying having signed them.

## Review of Desmedt et al.

### Carmichael function

From wikipedia:

The Carmichael function $\lambda(n)$ (where $n$ is a positive integer) is the
smallest positive integer $m$ such that $a^m \equiv 1 (\mod n)$ holds for every
integer $a$ coprime to $n$, where two integers are coprimes if their only common
integer factor is 1.

The above expression is a way to write $a^m$ is 'congruent' modulo $n$ to $1$;
where terms $x$ and $y$ are congruent modulo $z$ if $x \mod z = y \mod z$,
alternately, $z$ is a divisor of the difference between the terms, or there
exists some $K$ that $x - y = z * K$ alternately $z \mid (x -y)$. (z *is a
factor of* x - y)

# Questions

- Why should a bitcoin multisignature scheme care about this problem?
  Alternatively asked, what could be the advantages of a hypothetical scheme
  that wasn't constrained to provide the guarantee that "signers cannot deny
  having signed the message"?
