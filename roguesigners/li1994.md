# Notes on "Remark on the Threshold RSA Signature Scheme"

This paper demonstrates that Desmedt and Frankel's 1991 `(k, l)` threshold signature
scheme[^1], where a group secret `K` can be divided into `l` many shares, and the
group signature can be produced with `k`  many shares (`k <= l`), has the
following design goal:

    "The signing group holds the responsibility to the signed message. That is,
     each signer in this group cannot deny having signed the message."

is vulnerable to an attack where `>= k` conspiring members of the group `l` can
reveal the group secret of the scheme and consequently sign messages while
denying having signed them.

## Review of Desmedt et al.

### Carmichael function

From wikipedia:

The Carmichael function $\lambda(n)$ (where $n$ is a positive integer) is the
smallest positive integer $m$ such that $a^m \equiv 1   (mod n)$ holds for every
integer $a$ coprime to $n$, where two integers are coprimes if their only common
integer factor is 1.

This is an apparently standard way to write $a^m$ is 'congruent'  modulo $n$ to
$1$ where congruent modulo $n$ means $n$ is a divisor of the difference between
the terms.

In other words, there exists some $k$ such that $a^m - 1 = k n$ or alternately
$a^m = k n + 1$
