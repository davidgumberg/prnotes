# [#29335](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29335)

I think it would be good to stop the test runner once we actually run into an out of disk space error

Something like this:

```diff
 while i < test_count:
     if failfast and not all_passed:
         break
     for test_result, testdir, stdout, stderr, skip_reason in job_queue.get_next():
         test_results.append(test_result)
         i += 1
         done_str = "{}/{} - {}{}{}".format(i, test_count, BOLD[1], test_result.name, BOLD[0])
         if test_result.status == "Passed":
             logging.debug("%s passed, Duration: %s s" % (done_str, test_result.time))
         elif test_result.status == "Skipped":
             logging.debug(f"{done_str} skipped ({skip_reason})")
         else:
             all_passed = False
             print("%s failed, Duration: %s s\n" % (done_str, test_result.time))
             print(BOLD[1] + 'stdout:\n' + BOLD[0] + stdout + '\n')
             print(BOLD[1] + 'stderr:\n' + BOLD[0] + stderr + '\n')
             if combined_logs_len and os.path.isdir(testdir):
                 pass #[omitted]

+       if stderr.strip().split('\n')[-1] == "OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device":
+           logging.debug(f"Early exiting after test failure due to disk running out of space in {tmpdir}")
+           break
+
        if failfast:
            logging.debug("Early exiting after test failure")
            break
 ```

We could also avoid the question of picking a good number for warning if we used this approach without printing any warning, while still solving the underlying issue of stopping the test runner from continuing to dump test failures and errors that are not obviously related to being out of disk space, and having an opportunity to communicate the reason for failure to the user.

I am not opposed to the warning message, but if we keep it I think it should
1) use a number that is closer to the upper bound of space that might be used
2) use language more like: `there may be insufficient free space in {tmpdir} to run the bitcoin functional test suite. Running the test suite with fewer than {amt} of free space might cause tests to fail.`
