## Cluster mempool

Rough sketch:

- Maintain a constant ordering of the mempool.
- Limit time required by breaking mempool into clusters of related (by dependency)
  transactions with some maximum cluster size. 
- If you have a cluster of related transactions {A, B, C, D, E}, and the order
  which you would want to include them in is ${A, B, C, E, D}$, say if 
  lines which might be included from the transaction.
Maintain a strict ordering of what transactions you would include first in a
cluster, if you plot this on a graph where the $x$-axis is vbytes and the
$y$-axis is fees, you can plot each cluster as a line. In the same order that
you would include transactions, plot points of the total vbytes used so far and
the total fees acquired so far.
