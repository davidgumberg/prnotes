- Is there not a better way to get the wallet to know something about the
  chainstate tip then what is done in getlastblockhash/getlastblockheight?
    - Why does MigrateLegacyToDescriptor particularly care if the wallet's "best
      block hash" is in the chaintip? I can't tell if this is some particular
      edge case that gets handled, because to me it seems like an egregious
      error that should never happen.
        -  It doesn't care, it just needs a locator for chainStateFlushed, and
           it needs to make sure one was actually acquired.
- Why do both RemoveWallet and WaitForDeleteWallet() exist? I think maybe both
  have to happen, since afaict they usually come in a pair, and error handling
  is done for removewallet, which appears first, before doing the
  "waitfordelete". (Which I think is a little more active than its name
  suggests.)
