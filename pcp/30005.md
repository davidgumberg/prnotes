# [#30005](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30005) IPv6 PCP pinhole test
_All code comments in `[]` are my own._

## Background

### PCP ([RFC 6887](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6887))

#### Traditional NAT ([RFC 3022](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3022))
> The need for IP Address translation arises when a network's internal
> IP addresses cannot be used outside the network either for privacy reasons or
> because they are invalid for use outside the network.

RFC 3022 describes an Address Translation operation it refers to as "Traditional
NAT".

In traditional NAT, sessions are uni-directional, outbound from the private
network.

Devices within a "stub network" route packets to stub routers at the borders of
stub domains which translate source addresses only guaranteed to be unique
within the stub domain into globally unique addresses. If the number of stub
domain addresses is equal to or exceeded by the number of globally unique
addresses, the stub router can assign each private address in its stub domain a
globally unique address.

In the case where the number of internal addresses exceeds the number of
globally unique addresses available to the stub network, Network Address Port
Translation (NAPT) is used, which can assign each internal address a unique
destination port, it stores this mapping in a table, and modifies the source of every outbound
packet with a given private source address and port, to a globally unique
source address, and maps every inbound packet with a globally unique
destination address and port to the stub domain's private address and port.
