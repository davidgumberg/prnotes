## Problem

If you set `fNetworkActive` to false shortly after a new v2 connection is being
attempted, there is a chance that `DisconnectNodes` will flag it to be retried
as a v1 connection, when there is no chance for this connection to succeed. As
one reviewer [points
out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32073#pullrequestreview-2689560351),
presently this cannot actually cause any issues, but this is PR safeguards
against an introduction in the future of an issue like
[#13038](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13038), and prevents an
unnecessary message from being logged. 

An abridged `DisconnectNodes()` to see why the issue occurs:

```cpp
void CConnman::DisconnectNodes()
{
    // [ if the flag is set false, flag all nodes for disconnection. ]
    if (!fNetworkActive) {
        // Disconnect any connected nodes
        for (CNode* pnode : m_nodes) {
            if (!pnode->fDisconnect) {
                LogDebug(BCLog::NET, "Network not active, %s\n", pnode->DisconnectMsg(fLogIPs));
                pnode->fDisconnect = true;
            }
        }
    }

    // Disconnect unused nodes
    std::vector<CNode*> nodes_copy = m_nodes;
    // [ The loop where all nodes flagged for disconnect are actually
    //   disconnected. ]
    for (CNode* pnode : nodes_copy)
    {
        if (pnode->fDisconnect)
        {
            // remove from m_nodes
            m_nodes.erase(remove(m_nodes.begin(), m_nodes.end(), pnode), m_nodes.end());
        
            // [ AFAIK, no way for `m_transport` to know about the connman
            //   state, so `ShouldReconnectV1()` doesn't care if
            //   `fNetworkActive` is false, or any other network condition that
            //   might make us want to reconsider flagging for reconnection. A
            //   reviewer points out: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32073#pullrequestreview-2689560351) 
            //   That even after this PR, this issue will persist for other
            //   situations where it doesn't make sense to flag for reconnect. ]
            // Add to reconnection list if appropriate.
            if (pnode->m_transport->ShouldReconnectV1()) {
                reconnections_to_add.push_back({
                    .addr_connect = pnode->addr,
                    .grant = std::move(pnode->grantOutbound),
                    .destination = pnode->m_dest,
                    .conn_type = pnode->m_conn_type,
                    .use_v2transport = false});
                LogDebug(BCLog::NET, "retrying with v1 transport protocol for peer=%d\n", pnode->GetId());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution

Pretty simple, we check if `fNetworkActive` before checking if we
`ShouldReconnectV1`:

```diff
-                if (pnode->m_transport->ShouldReconnectV1()) {
+                if (fNetworkActive && pnode->m_transport->ShouldReconnectV1()) {
```

With a slight tweak in the real pr to cache `fNetworkActive` at the
beginning of `DisconnectNodes()`, which I think is slightly worse than this
diff, but see discussion here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32073#pullrequestreview-2690008496

### [net: Block v2->v1 transport downgrade if !CConnman::fNetworkActive](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32073/commits/6869fb417096b43ba7f74bf767ca3e41b9894899)

	We might have just set CNode::fDisconnect in the first loop because of being offline.

    Also caches CConnman::fNetworkActive in case it's changed concurrently with our own thread.

## Validation

Tested using a slight tweak of the author's suggested review script, since it's
anecdotally most likely to occur on startup, probably because of the number of
new connections we're making.

```bash
./build/src/bitcoind -debug=net -daemonwait -signet && sleep 20 && ./build/src/bitcoin-cli -signet setnetworkactive false && sleep 0.5 && ./build/src/bitcoin-cli -signet setnetworkactive true && sleep 0.5 && ./build/src/bitcoin-cli -signet stop
```
