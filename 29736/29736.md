# [#29736](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29736) test: Extends wait_for_getheaders so a specific block hash can be checked
_All code comments in `[]` are my own._

## Problem

The functional test p2p framework has a utility method `wait_for_getheaders`
which is used in functional tests to ensure successful connection handshakes
between two peers, by waiting until a result is present in
`self.last_message.get("getheaders")`. `wait_for_getheaders` is part of a family
of `wait_for_*` methods in the P2P test framework.

At present, the getheaders message will be satisfied if any
`last_message["getheaders"]`[^1] exists, since no checking of the block hash is
done. This also means that in tests when multiple getheaders might be exchanged, we
have to manually reset `last_message["getheaders"]` before using
`wait_for_getheaders`.

Further, at present, successful use of `wait_for_getheaders` relies on
`last_message.get("getheaders")` being cleared between tests.

### Existing `wait_for_getheaders`

</summary>


```python
def wait_for_getheaders(self, *, timeout=60):
    """Waits for a getheaders message.

    Receiving any getheaders message will satisfy the predicate. the last_message["getheaders"]
    value must be explicitly cleared before calling this method, or this will return
    immediately with success. TODO: change this method to take a hash value and only
    return true if the correct block header has been requested."""
    def test_function():
        return self.last_message.get("getheaders")

    # [ wait_until sleeps until `test_function` returns true ]
    self.wait_until(test_function, timeout=timeout)
```

</details>


## Solution

This PR adds a parameter `block_hash` to `wait_for_getheaders` which allows the
caller to request that a specific block_hash be at the top of the `GETHEADERS`
locator hash vector. In other words, the header of the newest block that the
block requesting peer knows of.

Additionally, it does `last_message.pop("getheaders")` so that the calling
function is no longer responsible for clearing before the next call.

### Modified `wait_for_getheaders`

</summary>

```python
def wait_for_getheaders(self, block_hash=None, *, timeout=60):
    """Waits for a getheaders message containing a specific block hash.

    If no block hash is provided, checks whether any getheaders message has been received by the node."""
    def test_function():
        # [ Pop the last getheaders message so that it's cleared after this
        #   wait_for_getheaders. ]
        last_getheaders = self.last_message.pop("getheaders", None)
        
        # [ Don't check anything if the caller doesn't pass a block_hash, just
        #   return whether or not the last_message.pop was successful
        if block_hash is None:
             return last_getheaders

        # [ If we haven't received a block yet, return False so wait_for can
        #   keep sleeping ðŸ’¤ ]
        if last_getheaders is None:
            return False

        # [ Check if the requested block_hash is equal to the first (newest)
        #   hash in the block locator vector. ]
        return block_hash == last_getheaders.locator.vHave[0]

    self.wait_until(test_function, timeout=timeout)
```

</details>

## Particulars

This change to `wait_for_getheaders` necessitates some changes to functional
tests that make use of the `wait_for_getheaders` interface..
