## Problem

The functional test p2p framework has a utility method `wait_for_getheaders` which is used in
functional tests to ensure successful connection handshakes between two peers, by making  and is part
of a family of `wait_for_*` methods in the P2P test framework.

At present, the getheaders message will be satisfied if any
`last_message["getheaders"]`[^1] call exists, since no checking of the block hash is done.
This means, that in tests when multiple getheaders might be exchanged, we have to manually
reset `last_message["getheaders"]` before using `wait_for_getheaders`.

## Solution

[^1]: `last_message` is a dict that uses the names of message type's as key's and  stores the
most recently received message of that type as a value
