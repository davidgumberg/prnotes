# [#30884](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30884) streams: cache file position within AutoFile
_All code comments in `[]` are my own._

## Background

Issue [#30833](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30833) provided
evidence of severely degraded IBD performance in the 28.0 release candidate
compared to v27.1 on Windows. I was able to reproduce this slow IBD on a
Thinkpad T470 running Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC version 1809, but other
contributors weren't able to.

The issue author was able to
[bisect](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30833#issuecomment-2335184072)
the regression to [PR #28025](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28025),
and I reproduced this as well. #28025 introduced XOR'ing of blocksdir *.dat
files. It is part of a long running
[series](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6650) of PR's that have been
XOR'ing all of the data that we store on disk not because they contain
cryptographic secrets but to prevent bad actors from inserting sequences of data
that match known signatures for malware that A/V software detects and
quarantines. We basically just xor all data we write agains a random pattern of
8 bytes. 

I believe that a relatively slow disk is part of what is needed to reproduce
#30833, since my attempts to reproduce on a faster more modern machine failed. I
suspect that the regression is still present, but less significant compared to
the other performance gains for IBD that 28.0 has over 27.1 on devices with fast
I/O.

I ran `bitcoind` with `-debug=bench` which provides a set of informative
benchmarks related to the performance of `ConnectBlock`. My [bench
logs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30833#issuecomment-2336837979)
indicated that the biggest reported performance loss came from Writing undo
blocks, and another contributor noted that this was strange given the relatively
small size of undo writes, and
[suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30833#issuecomment-2336842376)
that even more of the loss came from the block writes that happens in
`AcceptBlock`.

## Problem

`AutoFile` is the class responsible for the reading and writing of blocksdir
files, let's take a look at the main performance boogeyman `AutoFile::write`
after the merge of [PR #28025](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28025):

```cpp
// [ Writes the bytes in src to the AutoFile's std::FILE* m_file ]
void AutoFile::write(Span<const std::byte> src)
{
    if (!m_file) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::write: file handle is nullptr");
    // [ The old path, short and sweet. ðŸ¥² ]
        if (std::fwrite(src.data(), 1, src.size(), m_file) != src.size()) {
            throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::write: write failed");
        }
    // [ Now, in 28.0rc1, we always follow this else path when writing block
    //   data ]
    } else {
        // [ This is the line of interest, we need to get our position in the
        //   FILE since it is needed by the Xor function below for determining 
        //   where we left off with the last time we were rolling the Xor
        //   pattern. I'll leave discussion of why this is problematic for
        //   below. ]
        auto current_pos{std::ftell(m_file)};
        if (current_pos < 0) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::write: ftell failed");

        // [ We are going to buffer writes into chunks of 4kb (the most common
        //   file block size afaik. ]
        std::array<std::byte, 4096> buf;
        while (src.size() > 0) {
            // [ Create a view of the buffer array ('buf') as long as the first
            //   buf.size() many bytes of buf, or just long enough to fit
            //   the source buffer that we are writing. ]
            auto buf_now{Span{buf}.first(std::min<size_t>(src.size(), buf.size()))};

            // [ Copy the range beginning with src.begin() and ending with
            //   src.begin() + buf_now.size() into buf_now.begin() ]
            std::copy(src.begin(), src.begin() + buf_now.size(), buf_now.begin());
            // [ xor buf_now with the m_xor key, use current_pos to determine
            //   where we left off. ]
            util::Xor(buf_now, m_xor, current_pos);

            // [ fwrite the contents of buf_now into m_file. ]
            if (std::fwrite(buf_now.data(), 1, buf_now.size(), m_file) != buf_now.size()) {
                // [ If we didn't write buf_now.size() many bytes, we are not
                //   happy! ]
                throw std::ios_base::failure{"XorFile::write: failed"};
            }

            // [ subspan returns a view that starts from src.begin() + the
            //   passed offset argument, buf_now.size() here. ]
            src = src.subspan(buf_now.size());
            
            // [ iterate the current_pos by buf_now.size(), this avoids even
            //   more excessive ftell calls in every iteration of this while
            //   loop. ]
            current_pos += buf_now.size();
        }
    }
}
```

What turns out to be the problem here is the `ftell` on the xor path, which is
necessary for the xor utility function because we won't always be writing from
the beginning of a file, and will need to know our current position in the file
modulo the key length in order to continue xoring from where we left off.

util::Xor():

```cpp
// [ We need the file position because we need the key offset. i.e. When
//   rolling the xor pattern, serialization lengths don't necessarily align
//   with the key length (8 in the case of the block data), and we want a
//   reader to be able to go from the beginning of the file to the end
//   using the same pattern, so we need to get the file position modulo
//   the key size to find where we should continue from. ]
inline void Xor(Span<std::byte> write, Span<const std::byte> key, size_t key_offset = 0)
{
    if (key.size() == 0) {
        return;
    }
    // [ File position % key size = to the index of which byte of the key to
    //   roll over the next byte of the buffer we're writing. ]
    key_offset %= key.size();

    for (size_t i = 0, j = key_offset; i != write.size(); i++) {
        // [ Xor i'th index of write with the j'th index of key ]
        write[i] ^= key[j++];

        // This potentially acts on very many bytes of data, so it's
        // important that we calculate `j`, i.e. the `key` index in this
        // way instead of doing a %, which would effectively be a division
        // for each byte Xor'd -- much slower than need be.
        if (j == key.size())
            j = 0;
    }
}
```

It turns out that it is very possible that a naive implementation of `ftell` is
equivalent to `fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_CUR)`, except if `fseek` returned the file
position offset as well as setting it. This happend in glibc and resulted in
performance degradation in uses cases similar to ours, frequent writes and
frequent `ftell` calls:

[PATCH][BZ #5298] Don't flush write buffer for ftell
    From: Siddhesh Poyarekar <siddhesh at redhat dot com>
    To: libc-alpha at sourceware dot org
    Date: Fri, 7 Sep 2012 14:07:59 +0530
    Subject: [PATCH][BZ #5298] Don't flush write buffer for ftell

Hi,

The current implementation of ftell is basically equivalent to
fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_CUR). While this is not incorrect, it results in
inheritance of limitations of fseek, which is summarized in the
following comment in the source:

  /* Flush unwritten characters.
     (This may do an unneeded write if we seek within the buffer.
     But to be able to switch to reading, we would need to set
     egptr to ptr.  That can't be done in the current design,
     which assumes file_ptr() is eGptr.  Anyway, since we probably
     end up flushing when we close(), it doesn't make much difference.)
     FIXME: simulate mem-papped files. */

This is not needed for ftell since it does not need to set or
modify buffer state, so this flush can be avoided. Attached patch
computes current position for ftell (within the file_seekoff functions
as a special case) without flushing the buffers when in write mode. I
have used a modified version of the sample program in the bz (appended
to this email) to check the improvement in performance in each call and
the average reads as below on my Fedora 16 x86_64 core i5 laptop with
4GB RAM:

Without patch:
Total time: 9174470.000000 ns. AVG 1819.609282 ns per call

With patch:
Total time: 1047375.000000 ns. AVG 207.730067 ns per call

I have verified that the change does not cause any regressions in the
testsuite.

Regards,
Siddhesh

The problem with borrowing `fseek` logic is the following from [IEEE Std
1003.1-2017](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/functions/fseek.html)
description of `int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence)`:


```
If the stream is writable and buffered data had not been written to the
underlying file, fseek() shall cause the unwritten data to be written to the
file and shall mark the last data modification and last file status change
timestamps of the file for update.
```

That should be enough, but if we are being pedantic, the `glibc` authors suggest
that flushing is not necessary as long as we are seeking an offset inside of the
same buffer as the write, but due to a design constraint, avoiding the flush in
glibc is not possible:

My vague gesturing at comprehension of the problem with borrowing `fseek` logic,
and why `fseek` requires a flush in the first place, at least in glibc's design,
is that because of complications around the write offset/pointer not being equal
to the read pointer/offset, when we have been writing and then want to seek from
`SEEK_CUR`, we need to switch the file pointer from the write pointer to the
read pointer before seeking. And for reasons slightly outside my comprehension,
doing that needs to which for reasons beyond my comprehension, in glibc requires
a flush. Here's what glibc has to
[say](https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c9154cad66aa0b11ede62cc9190d3485c5ef6941/libio/fileops.c#L920-L928)
for itself:

```c
  /* Flush unwritten characters.
     (This may do an unneeded write if we seek within the buffer.
     But to be able to switch to reading, we would need to set
     egptr to pptr.  That can't be done in the current design,
     which assumes file_ptr() is eGptr.  Anyway, since we probably
     end up flushing when we close(), it doesn't make much difference.)
     FIXME: simulate mem-mapped files. */
  if (was_writing) {
    _IO_switch_to_get_mode (fp))
  }

  // [ Code slightly editorialized for readability]
    return EOF;


if (was_writing && _IO_switch_to_get_mode (fp))
    return EOF;
```

To be honest, I can't tell whether this design of `ftell` is natural/obvious or
if Microsoft/glibc have been peeking at each other's or something earlier's
notes. But it is very likely this exact issue of `ftell` unnecessarily causing a
flush still exists at least in Windows 10 (no one reproduced the regression in
11, not sure if anyone tried.)

## Solution

The author of [#30884](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30844] solves
this by making AutoFile responsible for maintaining it's own file offset. This
allows us to avoid an `ftell` invocation before every xor'ed write and avoid
unnecessary flushes on every write.

## streams: cache file position within AutoFile (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30884/commits/4cfff4e58c6d806e4bc5a12386f84ff207c83419)

Adds a parameter `m_position` to `AutoFile` which should **always** be equal to
`std::ftell(m_file)`. It might be nice to add a `SanityCheck` method and some
tests to `AutoFile` that makes sure that is always true. An `Assume` might be
bad here, since I don't think it's reasonable to expect >2x performance
deterioration in debug builds.

### Changes to AutoFile

```cpp
/** Non-refcounted RAII wrapper for FILE*
 *
 * Will automatically close the file when it goes out of scope if not null.
 * If you're returning the file pointer, return file.release().
 * If you need to close the file early, use file.fclose() instead of fclose(file).
 */
class AutoFile
{
protected:
    std::FILE* m_file;
    std::vector<std::byte> m_xor;
    int64_t m_position;
```


`AutoFile` gets a custom constructor that initializes the value of `m_position`:

```cpp
AutoFile::AutoFile(std::FILE* file, std::vector<std::byte> data_xor)
    : m_file{file}, m_xor{std::move(data_xor)}, m_position{0}
{
    if (!IsNull()) {
        auto pos{std::ftell(m_file)};
        if (pos >= 0) m_position = pos;
    }
}
```

`AutoFile::tell()` changes from being an `ftell` wrapper to just returning
`m_position`:

```cpp
    int64_t tell() noexcept { return m_position; }
```



<details> <summary>Old tell()</summary>


```cpp
int64_t AutoFile::tell()
{
    if (IsNull()) {
        throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::tell: file handle is nullptr");
    }
    int64_t r{std::ftell(m_file)};
    if (r < 0) {
        throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::tell: ftell failed");
    }
    return r;
}
```

</details>

`AutoFile::seek` now has to modify the `m_position`:

```cpp
void AutoFile::seek(int64_t offset, int origin)
{
    if (IsNull()) {
        throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::seek: file handle is nullptr");
    }
    if (std::fseek(m_file, offset, origin) != 0) {
        throw std::ios_base::failure(feof() ? "AutoFile::seek: end of file" : "AutoFile::seek: fseek failed");
    }

    // [ everything below is what was added ]

    // [ posix says about fseek:
    //   The fseek() function shall set the file-position indicator for the
    //   stream pointed to by stream. If a read or write error occurs, the error
    //   indicator for the stream shall be set and fseek() fails.
    //   
    //   The new position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file,
    //   shall be obtained by adding offset to the position specified by whence.
    //   The specified point is the beginning of the file for SEEK_SET, the
    //   current value of the file-position indicator for SEEK_CUR, or
    //   end-of-file for SEEK_END.

    // [ If the position is being set absolutely, and fseek succeeds, the new
    //   offset is file beginning (0) + offset which is equal to offset  ]
    if (origin == SEEK_SET) {
        m_position = offset;
    // [ If the position is being set from the current, then new offset
    //   is current + offset ]
    } else if (origin == SEEK_CUR) {
        m_position += offset;
    } else {
        int64_t r{std::ftell(m_file)};
        if (r < 0) {
            throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::seek: ftell failed");
        }
        m_position = r;
    }
}
```

The new `AutoFile::write`:

```diff
 void AutoFile::write(Span<const std::byte> src)
 {
     if (!m_file) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::write: file handle is nullptr");
     if (m_xor.empty()) {
         if (std::fwrite(src.data(), 1, src.size(), m_file) != src.size()) {
             throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::write: write failed");
         }
         // [ fwrite increments the file pointer by src.size() ]
+        m_position += src.size();
     } else {
         // [ No need to `ftell` the current position, we can use our 
         //   m_position. ]
-        auto current_pos{std::ftell(m_file)};
-        if (current_pos < 0) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::write: ftell failed");
         std::array<std::byte, 4096> buf;
         while (src.size() > 0) {
             auto buf_now{Span{buf}.first(std::min<size_t>(src.size(), buf.size()))};
             std::copy(src.begin(), src.begin() + buf_now.size(), buf_now.begin());
-            util::Xor(buf_now, m_xor, current_pos);
+            util::Xor(buf_now, m_xor, m_position);
             if (std::fwrite(buf_now.data(), 1, buf_now.size(), m_file) != buf_now.size()) {
                 throw std::ios_base::failure{"XorFile::write: failed"};
             }
             src = src.subspan(buf_now.size());
-            current_pos += buf_now.size();
+            m_position += buf_now.size();
         }
     }
 }
```

The same applies to `AutoFile::detail_fread`:

```cpp
std::size_t AutoFile::detail_fread(Span<std::byte> dst)
{
    if (!m_file) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::read: file handle is nullptr");

    // [ In the non xor case this is all we do: read dst.size() many bytes from
    //   m_file ]
    size_t ret = std::fread(dst.data(), 1, dst.size(), m_file);
    // [ If we are xor'ing then: ]
    if (!m_xor.empty()) {
        // [ the subspan is here since dst might be bigger than the amount of
        //   bytes we read from the file
        util::Xor(dst.subspan(0, ret), m_xor, m_position);
    }
    // [ Increment `m_position` by the number of bytes we `fread` above. ]
    m_position += ret;
    return ret;
}
```

<details>


<summary>Old detail_fread</summary>


```cpp
std::size_t AutoFile::detail_fread(Span<std::byte> dst)
{
    if (!m_file) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::read: file handle is nullptr");

    // [ In the non-xor case, just read and return. ]
    if (m_xor.empty()) {
        return std::fread(dst.data(), 1, dst.size(), m_file);
    } else {
        // [ The performance hogging ftell... ]
        const auto init_pos{std::ftell(m_file)};
        if (init_pos < 0) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::read: ftell failed");
        // [ fread the data into ret... ]
        std::size_t ret{std::fread(dst.data(), 1, dst.size(), m_file)};
        // [ xor the subspan of dst that was written into...]
        util::Xor(dst.subspan(0, ret), m_xor, init_pos);
        return ret;
    }
}
```

</details>

`AutoFile::Ignore` is touched as well:

```cpp
// [ Used to seek over `nSize` many bytes of the file.
//   Could alternatively be file.seek(nSize, SEEK_CUR) ]
void AutoFile::ignore(size_t nSize)
{
    if (!m_file) throw std::ios_base::failure("AutoFile::ignore: file handle is nullptr");
    // [ Looks familiar, 4kb buffer... ]
    unsigned char data[4096];
    while (nSize > 0) {
        // [ nNow is the size of the data buffer or the amount we are going to
        //   ignore ] 
        size_t nNow = std::min<size_t>(nSize, sizeof(data));
        // [ read nSize many bytes into the data hole ]
        if (std::fread(data, 1, nNow, m_file) != nNow) {
            throw std::ios_base::failure(feof() ? "AutoFile::ignore: end of file" : "AutoFile::ignore: fread failed");
        }
        // [ decrement the number of bytes remaining to skip over. ]
        nSize -= nNow;
        // [ increment m_position by the number of bytes skipped. ]
        m_position += nNow;
    }
}
```

### Changes for AutoFile users

Users of AutoFile today can get access to the raw FILE* with AutoFile::Get(),
and there are a few places where they use that to manipulate the file pointer,
this PR changes those to use the AutoFile
methods that change `m_position` to respect the changed file pointer position, I
won't reproduce every example here but they look like:

`src/bench/streams_findbyte.cpp`:
```diff
-    std::rewind(file.Get());
+    file.seek(0, SEEK_SET);
```

and

`src/util/asmap.c`:
```diff
-   fseek(filestr, 0, SEEK_END);
-   int length = ftell(filestr);
+   file.seek(0, SEEK_END);
+   int length = file.tell();
```
