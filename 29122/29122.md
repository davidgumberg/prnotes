# test: adds outbound eviction functional tests, updates comments in ConsiderEviction

## test_outbound_eviction_unprotected
    - NOTE: the reason we keep calling sync_with_ping is that it assures us that
    `SendMessages` will be called which triggers ConsiderEviction
    - Set up our node
    - create an outbound-full-relay peer `test_node` for our node
    - sync_with_ping gets the clock rolling
    - set mock_time 20 minutes + 1 second in the future
    - sync_with_ping triggers the headers response time out
    - let `test_node` wait to receive a `getheaders` message from us
    - set mock_time 2 minutes + 1 second in the future
    - We should get evicted: `test_node.wait_for_disconnect()`


    - for the second test we do the exact same thing but have `test_node` send us old headers instead of no headers

    - for the third test, 10x: advance time past the chain_sync_timeout, then update `test_node`'s tip to our best when 
      set an eviction timer for them then wait foor the headers_response_timeout then make sure we are still connected

## test_outbound_eviction_protected
    - The same as above but first make us and `test_node` have equal tips so that we grant them protection
