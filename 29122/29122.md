# test: adds outbound eviction functional tests, updates comments in ConsiderEviction

## test_outbound_eviction_unprotected

### First test
__NOTE: the reason we keep calling sync_with_ping is that it assures us that
`SendMessages` will be called which triggers ConsiderEviction__
- Set up our node
- create an outbound-full-relay peer `test_node` for our node
- sync_with_ping gets the clock rolling
- set mock_time 20 minutes + 1 second in the future
- sync_with_ping triggers the headers response time out
- let `test_node` wait to receive a `getheaders` message from us
- set mock_time 2 minutes + 1 second in the future
- We should get evicted: `test_node.wait_for_disconnect()`

### Test, second
For the second test we do the exact same thing but have `test_node` send us
old headers instead of no headers, it should disconnect after chain sync timeout
passes (20 minutes) then getheaders is sent, then headers_response_time passes
(2 minutes) and we disconnect.

```diff
-        peer.sync_with_ping()
+        peer.send_and_ping(msg_headers([prev_header]))
```

### Third test
In the third test, we never let the peer catch up with our tip, but continually
let them catch up with the tip we had when we set an eviction timer for them.
When this happens, we reset the timeout:
```cpp
state.m_chain_sync.m_timeout = time_in_seconds + CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT;
```

Giving them another `CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT` (20 minutes) to catch up.

The test does 10x: advance time past the chain_sync_timeout, then update
`test_node`'s tip to our best when set an eviction timer for them then wait for
the `HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME` (2 minutes) then make sure we are still connected.

At the end, this test checks that if a peer who has had an eviction timeout set catches up with
our current tip, we clear the timeout.

```python
# Send an updated headers message matching our tip
peer.send_and_ping(msg_headers([from_hex(CBlockHeader(), node.getblockheader(best_block_hash, False))]))

# Wait for long enough for the timeouts to have triggered and check that we are still connected
cur_mock_time += (CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT + 1)
node.setmocktime(cur_mock_time)
peer.sync_with_ping()
cur_mock_time += (HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME + 1)
node.setmocktime(cur_mock_time)
self.log.info("Test that the peer does not get evicted")
peer.sync_with_ping()
```

## `test_outbound_eviction_protected`
Checks that if a peer that is granted eviction protection fails behind and fails
to catch up for `CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT + HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME`.

We make the peer protected by having it connect to us and send a headers message
with our current tip. Then, we repeat the timeout procedure described above.

## `test_outbound_eviction_mixed`
Create four outbound peers using the same procedure described above.

```python
# We protect up to 4 peers as long as they have provided a block with the same amount of work as our tip
self.log.info("The first 4 peers are protected by sending us a valid block with enough work")
tip_header = from_hex(CBlockHeader(), node.getblockheader(node.getbestblockhash(), False))
headers_message = msg_headers([tip_header])
protected_peers = []
for i in range(4):
    peer = node.add_outbound_p2p_connection(P2PInterface(), p2p_idx=i, connection_type="outbound-full-relay")
    peer.send_and_ping(headers_message)
    protected_peers.append(peer)
```

We create four unprotected peers, all of whom send us an old tip. Two of which
are honest and will update their tips, and two of whome are dishonest, one never
updating their tip, and the other never sending us any blocks.

We generate a block, and time travel to when CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT is reached by
everyone, have all our protected peers and bad peers not do anything, and have
our `honest_unprotected_peers` catch up to our tip.

```python
# Let the timeouts hit and check back
cur_mock_time += (CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT + 1)
node.setmocktime(cur_mock_time)
for peer in protected_peers + misbehaving_unprotected_peers:
    peer.sync_with_ping()
    peer.wait_for_getheaders(block_hash=target_hash)
for peer in honest_unprotected_peers:
    peer.send_and_ping(tip_headers_message)
    peer.wait_for_getheaders(block_hash=target_hash)
```

Wait out the `HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME` and make sure our `protected_peers` and
`honest_unprotected_peers` are still connected, and that we have evicted both of
our `misbehaving_unprotected_peers`

```python
cur_mock_time += (HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME + 1)
node.setmocktime(cur_mock_time)
self.log.info("Check how none of the honest nor protected peers was evicted but all the misbehaving unprotected were")
for peer in protected_peers + honest_unprotected_peers:
    peer.sync_with_ping()
for peer in misbehaving_unprotected_peers:
    peer.wait_for_disconnect()
```

## `test_outbound_eviction_blocks_relay_only`
This is a variation of `test_outbound_eviction_protected` that make sure that
blocks only peers are not granted eviction protection, even if they are up to
tip.

## Notes

The tests added in this PR will not catch if we are triggering eviction logic
too early. e.g.:

```cpp
/** How long to wait for a peer to respond to a getheaders request */
static constexpr auto HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME{0s};
/** Timeout for (unprotected) outbound peers to sync to our chainwork */
static constexpr auto CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT{0s};
```

Will pass, since the way we do the eviction check every time is by fast
forwarding to 20 minutes in the future, which then triggers the
`HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME` timeout to be set.
