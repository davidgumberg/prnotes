# [#29415](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415) TITLE

Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections
_All code comments in `[]` are my own._

## Problem

Adds a transaction relay mode which improves node<-->wallet privacy by
"Broadcast[ing] own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections".

Reducing (how much?) the ability of a persistent listening attacker to associate
transactions with the real-world owner of a node, and correlating bundles of
transactions as belonging to the same node.

## Solution

### [log: introduce a new category for private broadcast](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415/commits/c467f3af828c1926b1b703d4516964f5ec7ab978)
Adds a new logging category `{"privatebroadcast", BCLog::PRIVATE_BROADCAST}` to `BCLog::LogFlags`.
(Enabled by starting bitcoind with `-debug privatebroadcast`)

### [init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415/commits/1407b3fa264b096813281a767da3cd3ca80ed096)
Adds a new bitcoind argument `-privatebroadcast`
