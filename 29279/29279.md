# [29729](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29279) Check disconnect due to lack of desirable service flags
All code comments in `[]` are my own

## ['Support Disconnect Waiting for `add_outbound_p2p_connection`'](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29279/commits/a991f1b5d12ee62d4f6a1404cab24ac8e055d337)

### Notes
- Adds a boolean parameter `wait_for_disconnect` that defaults to false
  for `add_outbound_p2p_connection`. If set to true, `add_outbound_p2p_connection`
  waits until the connection is closed to return. This is useful for testing outbound
  connections that we expect to fail.
- mzumsande suggests changing this to an `expect_success` parameter would make
  this parameter more flexible since in some scenarios we expect the connection
  to close before a version message. For example, during the v2 transport handshake

### Annotated
```python
def add_outbound_p2p_connection(self, p2p_conn, *, wait_for_verack=True, wait_for_disconnect=False, p2p_idx, connection_type="outbound-full-relay", supports_v2_p2p=None, advertise_v2_p2p=None, **kwargs):
    # [ This commit reuses the feeler connection logic ]
    if connection_type == "feeler" or wait_for_disconnect:
        # [ Wait for the peer to receive a version message ] 
        # feeler connections are closed as soon as the node receives a `version` message
        p2p_conn.wait_until(lambda: p2p_conn.message_count["version"] == 1, check_connected=False)

        # [ Wait for the peer to be disconnected ]
        p2p_conn.wait_until(lambda: not p2p_conn.is_connected, check_connected=False)

## [Check Disconnect Due to Lack of Desirable Service Flags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b6c7ae6bde48babea1ceb3820e522f841223d1d3) & ['Check Limited Peers Desirability'](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29279/commits/2f5b69eaeb623a7b0306e7f41fd2d28741f131c0)
### Notes on desirable service flags
- We only care about the service flags of full outbound relay, blocks-only relay,
  and get-addr connections, not inbound, manual or feeler connections.
- `DesirableServiceFlags`:
    - Always `NODE_WITNESS`
    - [BIP 159](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0159.mediawiki) proposed
      the `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED` service bit (`| 0x400`) to to advertise that node is 'pruned' and 
      and *is* capable of block relay, and header relay, transaction relay, and address
      relay like a `NODE_NETWORK`, but is only capable of serving a limited number of 
      historical blocks.
        - In particular, BIP 159 specifies:
            > NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED: If signaled, the peer MUST be capable of serving at least the last 288 blocks (~2 days). 
        - If a pruned node signalled exactly how many historical blocks it has, and it's peers just made sure that
          their tip was newer than the pruned node's historical cutoff, wouldn't block relay be better distributed 
          across pruned and full nodes on the network?
            - This poses a privacy problem. BIP 159 goes as far as to propose that pruned nodes **never** relay blocks older
              the 288 block cutoff
              
              > Peers may have different prune depths (depending on the peers configuration, disk space, etc.) which can result
              in a fingerprinting weakness (finding the prune depth through getdata requests). `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED` supporting
              peers SHOULD avoid leaking the prune depth and therefore not serve blocks deeper than the signaled
              `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED` threshold (288 blocks). 

    - If our peer advertises `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED` ('pruned node') **AND** we are close
      enough (`NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_ALLOW_CONN_BLOCKS = 144 blocks`; 24 hours) to our
      node's guess (`ApproximateBestBlockDepth()`) of the depth of the best block then we
      desire `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED`:
      ```cpp
      if (services & NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED) {
        if (ApproximateBestBlockDepth() < NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_ALLOW_CONN_BLOCKS) { // <- 144
        return ServiceFlags(NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED | NODE_WITNESS);
      ```
    - Otherwise, we are in an IBD-like situation and want a 'full node' peer:
      ```cpp
      return ServiceFlags(NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED | NODE_WITNESS);
      ```
        - Why 144 blocks?: (24 * 60) minutes are in a day, ~(24 * 60)/10 = 144 blocks are mined in a day.
            - This is smaller than the 288 historical blocks that peers setting the `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED` version
              bit *should* have [as proposed in](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0159.mediawiki#new-service-bit)
              BIP 159, so these peers *should* be able to serve us the blocks we request.
            - Unanswered question: Why isn't `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED_ALLOW_CONN_BLOCKS = 288` if this is the
              cutoff that pruned nodes should be able to serve us?
                - Maybe relevant: 
                  > A safety buffer of 144 blocks to handle chain reorganizations SHOULD be taken into account
                    when connecting to a peer signaling the NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED service bit. (BIP 159)

          when 
        - `ApproximateBestBlockDepth()` (annotated below) does the following: (pseudocode)
            `` (time.now() - our_best_block.time()) / time_between_blocks``
            - The time between blocks value (`nPowTargetSpacing`) is [hardcoded](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fce53f132e1b3f2c8bf1530dca18f3da136f08ab/src/kernel/chainparams.cpp#L91)
              in `src/kernel/chainparams.cpp` to 10 minutes:
                ```cpp
                consensus.nPowTargetSpacing = 10 * 60; 
                ``

### `P2PHandshakeTest`

#### Notes
- Uses a helper function `add_outbound_connection` that wraps the test framework's `add_outbound_connection`
  This `add_outbound_connection` loops through an array of service flag objects passed to it, and expects
  the version handshake to result in a disconnect or successful connection according to bool
  `wait_for_disconnect` for all connection types where we expect desirable service flags
    - We expect desirable service flags from outbound-full-relay, block-relay-only, and addr-fetch connections.
    - We won't evict manual, inbound, or feeler connection types.
        - Manual connections are protected because we assume the user wants them.
        - Why don't we care about the ServiceFlags of Inbound connections?
            - Is it simply because we don't require any of their services?
        - Feeler connections are terminated after we receive a version message from them anyways:
        ```cpp
        void PeerManagerImpl::ProcessMessage(CNode& pfrom, /*[...]*/) // [other arguments omitted]
            if (msg_type == NetMsgType::VERSION) {
                if (pfrom.IsFeelerConn()) {
                    LogPrint(BCLog::NET, "feeler connection completed peer=%d; disconnecting\n", pfrom.GetId());
                    pfrom.fDisconnect = true;
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
