# (\#29540)[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29540] validation: Use witness maleation flag for non-segwit blocks

*All comments in `[]` are my own*

## Background:

### `CheckWitnessMalleation`

`CheckWitnessMalleation` checks that for blocks where we expect[^1] a witness
commitment:

0. We haven't already checked and found that the Witness Commitment is not malleated.
```cpp
if (block.m_checked_witness_commitment) return true;
```

1. Whether the coinbase contains a [witness commitment
   output](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#commitment-structure)
   and if it does store it's vout index, (if it doesn't, we fall back to the
   pre-segwit logic below)
```cpp
int commitpos = GetWitnessCommitmentIndex(block);
if (commitpos != NO_WITNESS_COMMITMENT) {
```

2. The first input of the coinbase transaction only has one element on its
   witness stack that is 32 bytes long.
    - These 32 bytes are the "Witness Reserved Value", described in [BIP
      141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#commitment-structure).
      Today they don't do anything.

3. Check that `sha256d(block witness merkle root || witness reserved value` is
   equal to the witness commitment in the coinbase output.

If all of those are true, we set `block.m_checked_witness_commitment = true` and
`return true`.

Otherwise we have a block that does not commit to Witness data and we check
that:

No tx's have witness data, returning false if any do, true if all don't.

#### Annotated code

```cpp

/** CheckWitnessMalleation performs checks for block malleation with regard to
 * its witnesses.
 *
 * Note: If the witness commitment is expected (i.e. `expect_witness_commitment
 * = true`), then the block is required to have at least one transaction and the
 * first transaction needs to have at least one input. */

## validation: Use witness maleation flag for non-segwit blocks 

This PR caches the results for non-segwit blocks, the same way we cache the
expensive commitment check. Before the final `return true` statement, we set
`m_checked_witness_commitment = true`.

There was a race condition where we did not have a block's parent and so decided
that we did not expect a witness commitment and cached the check as true, even
if we later learn of the parent and discover that we do expect a commitment.
That race condition was fixed in
(#29524)[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29524] which prevented blocks
with no connection to a previous block from being checked for mutation.

Have to do more thinking: It seems difficult to reason about the possible race
conditions that exist here, what is the worst case scenario for caching a
witness commitment as unmalleated?

[^1]: We check if the block's parent is equal to or after the segwit activation height
      defined in src/kernel/chainparams.cpp: `consensus.SegwitHeight = 481824;`
      for mainnet: `DeploymentActiveAfter(prev_block, m_chainman, Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_SEGWIT)`
