# [#29401](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29401)

Remove `struct.pack` from almost all places in the functional test suite.

    struct.pack has many issues:

    - The format string consists of characters that may be confusing and may
      need to be looked up in the documentation, as opposed to using easy to
      understand self-documenting code.

This PR normalizes usage of `struct.pack` and then a scripted diff is used to
replace `struct.pack` with `int.to_bytes`
