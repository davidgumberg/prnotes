## Background

`CCoinsView` and `CCoinsViewBacked` are base classes that are meant to be
overriden by descendants.

### `class CCoinsView`
This class provides an abstraction for working with a txout dataset. It is the 
base class of descendant `CCoinsViewBacked`.


In practice, there is a sequence of `CCoinsViewCache`'s that are backed by either another
`CCoinsViewCache` or an ultimate `CCoinsViewDB final : public CCoinsView` that
is backed by the on-disk 'chainstate' db.

Source code for the `CCoinsView` base class
</summary>

```cpp
/** Abstract view on the open txout dataset. */
class CCoinsView
{
public:
    // [ COutPoint represents a `Txid hash` and vout index `uint32_t n`. ]
    /** Retrieve the Coin (unspent transaction output) for a given outpoint.
     *  Returns true only when an unspent coin was found, which is returned in coin.
     *  When false is returned, coin's value is unspecified.
     */
    virtual bool GetCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin &coin) const;

    //! Just check whether a given outpoint is unspent.
    virtual bool HaveCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint) const;

    //! Retrieve the block hash whose state this CCoinsView currently represents
    virtual uint256 GetBestBlock() const;

    //! Retrieve the range of blocks that may have been only partially written.
    //! If the database is in a consistent state, the result is the empty vector.
    //! Otherwise, a two-element vector is returned consisting of the new and
    //! the old block hash, in that order.
    virtual std::vector<uint256> GetHeadBlocks() const;

    //! Do a bulk modification (multiple Coin changes + BestBlock change).
    //! The passed pairs are a linked list that can be modified.
    //! If will_erase is true, the coins will be erased by the caller afterwards,
    //! so the coins can be moved out of the pairs instead of copied
    virtual bool BatchWrite(CoinsCachePair *pairs, const uint256 &hashBlock, bool will_erase = true);

    //! Get a cursor to iterate over the whole state
    virtual std::unique_ptr<CCoinsViewCursor> Cursor() const;

    //! As we use CCoinsViews polymorphically, have a virtual destructor
    virtual ~CCoinsView() {}

    //! Estimate database size (0 if not implemented)
    virtual size_t EstimateSize() const { return 0; }
};
```

### `class CCoinsViewBacked : public CCoinsView`

`CCoinsViewBacked` extends `CCoinView` with a protected attribute `CCoinsView
*base;` and a public setter method `void SetBackend(CCoinsView &viewIn)` to set
`base`. All of the virtual methods from `CCoinsView` are redeclared with the
`override` specifier and overriden to delegate to the backing CoinsView `base`'s
methods:

```cpp
CCoinsViewBacked::CCoinsViewBacked(CCoinsView *viewIn) : base(viewIn) { }
bool CCoinsViewBacked::GetCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin &coin) const { return base->GetCoin(outpoint, coin); }
bool CCoinsViewBacked::HaveCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint) const { return base->HaveCoin(outpoint); }
uint256 CCoinsViewBacked::GetBestBlock() const { return base->GetBestBlock(); }
std::vector<uint256> CCoinsViewBacked::GetHeadBlocks() const { return base->GetHeadBlocks(); }
void CCoinsViewBacked::SetBackend(CCoinsView &viewIn) { base = &viewIn; }
bool CCoinsViewBacked::BatchWrite(CCoinsMap &mapCoins, const uint256 &hashBlock, bool erase) { return base->BatchWrite(mapCoins, hashBlock, erase); }
std::unique_ptr<CCoinsViewCursor> CCoinsViewBacked::Cursor() const { return base->Cursor(); }
size_t CCoinsViewBacked::EstimateSize() const { return base->EstimateSize(); }
```

`class Coin` is used to represent a UTXO entry, its attributes are:
- `CTxOut out` which holds the `scriptPubKey` and `nValue` of a transaction
  output (txout).
- `unsigned int fCoinBase`: a boolean that represents whether or not
  the output's transaction was a coinbase.
- `uint32_t nHeight`: the height of the block this utxo was included in

### CCoinsCacheEntry

`CCoinsCacheEntry` is used for tracking the status of a coin "in one level of the
coins database caching hierarchy." Namely, whether or not that coin is spent or
unspent, `DIRTY` or `!DIRTY`, `FRESH` or `!FRESH`.

As described in the comments in `src/coins.h`:

`DIRTY`ness indicates that this cache entry is "potentially different from the
version in the parent cache", a `DIRTY` entry gets written on the next cache
flush.

`FRESH`ness indicates *either* "the parent cache does not have this coin" *or*
"it is a spent coin in the parent cache." `FRESH` coins can be spent without
being deleted from the parent cache on the next flush since the parent either 1)
does not know about the coin or 2) knows about the coin and knows that it is
spent. `coins.h` provides the following summary of the valid (5 out of 8)
possible states of these three indicators on a cache entry:

     Out of these 2^3 = 8 states, only some combinations are valid:
     - unspent, FRESH, DIRTY (e.g. a new coin created in the cache)
     - unspent, not FRESH, DIRTY (e.g. a coin changed in the cache during a reorg)
     - unspent, not FRESH, not DIRTY (e.g. an unspent coin fetched from the parent cache)
     - spent, FRESH, not DIRTY (e.g. a spent coin fetched from the parent cache)
     - spent, not FRESH, DIRTY (e.g. a coin is spent and spentness needs to be flushed to the parent)

Worth noting are the three invalid states:

- spent, not FRESH, not DIRTY - If a coin is not DIRTY, then our version does
  not differ from the parent cache, but if the parent cache sees a coin as spent
  then the coin is FRESH.
- unspent, FRESH, not DIRTY - If a coin is FRESH then the parent cache either
  does not know of it, or believes it to be spent. But since we know of it, AND
  believe it to be unspent, our version differs from the parent cache, so it
  shoult be DIRTY.
- spent, FRESH, DIRTY - I am less sure of this case. If the coin is FRESH then
  either our parent does not have it, or knows it as spent, and that seems fine.
  But why couldn't the coin be spent, our parent knows about it as spent, and
  DIRTY since something other than its spentness has changed?
