# [#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673) coins: remove logic for spent-and-FRESH cache entries and writing non-DIRTY entries
_All code comments in `[]` are my own._

## Background

In PR [#28280](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280) one reviewer
[mentioned](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280#discussion_r1655477509)
that a number of spots in the CCoinsView* logic perpetuated impossible code
paths that handled coins that could be spent, FRESH, but not DIRTY, which this
reviewer said was not a possible configuration for a coin. This PR aims to
remove all logic for handling spent-and-FRESH-but-not-DIRTY coins, and all
documentation suggesting that this is possible.

This PR revives the aims of [#18746](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18746)

### The Triarchy of CCoinCacheEntry State

`CCoinsCacheEntry`'s are the very stuff that make up that eponymous member
`CCoinsMap cacheCoins`[^1] of every `CCoinsViewCache`. A `CCoinsCacheEntry`
consists of a `Coin` and a set of `m_flags` which indicate whether or not it is
DIRTY or not, and FRESH or not. There is also a pair of pointers (`m_prev` &
`m_next`) which facilitate a doubly-linked list of flagged entries added in
#28280, but those won't be relevant here.

Every `CCoinsViewCache` is backed[^2] by some `CCoinsView`. Either by another
`CCoinsViewCache` which in turn has it's own backing, or, ultimately, by a
`CCoinsViewDB` which is "backed" by the on-disk Key-value database. (LevelDB,
accessed through `CDBWrapper`).

    ðŸ¤ž Usually the backing view refers to the on-disk backing, but there are
    regularly encountered instances where that is not the case, and an in-memory
    view is backed by another in-memory view, so at the expense of being
    pedantic, I try to maintain this ambiguity in my description below.

1. Spentness - Whether or not a given txid + vout (`COutpoint` / transaction
   output) is a transaction input (txin) to a valid transaction, i.e. is spent.
   This is encoded not with a flag, but by setting all the `Coin`'s members to
   be 0 or `NULL`.
2. DIRTYness - An entry flagged as `DIRTY` differs from the version present in
   the backing view of this cache, on the next `Sync`, update the backing view
   based on this entry.
3. FRESHness - An entry flagged as `FRESH` has either never been heard of by the
   backing view, or it is known by the backing view as spent. Flagging cache
   entries as `FRESH` let's us skip syncing coins to disk which we learned about
   and then saw get spent before we ever flushed them to disk, so the on-disk
   coinsdb is none-the-wiser that anything ever went down. ðŸ˜Ž

### The Big Question

Can a Coin be spent and `FRESH`? Following the advice of the reviewer that
[raised](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280#discussion_r1655477509)
this matter, let's first take a look at the three places where a coin can become
`FRESH`:

1. In `CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin()`:

```cpp
// [ Return an iterator to the cache map entry with the given COutPoint as its
//   key. If the outpoint is not found in the cache, fetch it from the backing
//   view ]
CCoinsMap::iterator CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint) const {
    // [ try_emplace returns a pair consisting of aan iterator pointing to the
    //   inserted or already present key,]
    const auto [ret, inserted] = cacheCoins.try_emplace(outpoint);
    // [ If insertion was successful, that means we didn't have this outpoint in
    //   our cache, and ret now points to a map entry with the outpoint as its
    //   key, and a default constructed CCoinsCacheEntry for its value, let's
    //   try to grab the coin from the backing view.. ]
    if (inserted) {
        // [ GetCoin modifies it's second argument `Coin&` to be equal to the
        //   Coin found in the view, and returns whether or not the coin was
        //   found. ]
        if (!base->GetCoin(outpoint, ret->second.coin)) {
            // [ If we don't find the coin in the base view, erase the entry we
            //   just emplaced into the cache map. ]
            cacheCoins.erase(ret);
            // [ Return std::end to indicate failure to `FetchCoin` ]
            return cacheCoins.end();
        }

        // [ If we reached this point, the cache didn't have the coin at the
        //   start of the call and we have since fetched the coin from the
        //   backing view. ]

        // [ Now, all-importantly, if the coin that we just fetched from the
        //   backing view is spent, then the entry should be flagged FRESH,
        //   since the backing view thinks it's spent.
        //
        //   The reviewer that raised this issue suggested that this codepath
        //   is not possible since if this coin is spent, the call to GetCoin
        //   above would have failed. ]
        if (ret->second.coin.IsSpent()) {
            // The parent only has an empty entry for this outpoint; we can consider our version as fresh.
            ret->second.AddFlags(CCoinsCacheEntry::FRESH, *ret, m_sentinel);
        }
        cachedCoinsUsage += ret->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();
    }
    return ret;
}
```

To summarize the above, a spent coin can be marked FRESH *if* it is not present
in the cache view when someone asks the cache view to fetch the coin and we have
to fetch it from the backing view, *but* when we inquire of the backing view for
the coin (`CCoinsView::GetCoin()`), and it gives us back a spent coin. The
reviewer that originally raised this matter, suggested that this code path is
impossible, since `GetCoin()` returns false in either the case that the coin is
spent, or that the coin is not known to the view, let's take a look at
`CCoinsViewCache::GetCoin()`:

```cpp
bool CCoinsViewCache::GetCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin &coin) const {
    // [ Not a circular dependency, since FetchCoin depends on the *backing*
    //   view's GetCoin. ]
    CCoinsMap::const_iterator it = FetchCoin(outpoint);
    // [ If the coin is found ... ]
    if (it != cacheCoins.end()) {
        // [ overwrite the argument as the side effect... ]
        coin = it->second.coin;
        // [ Return false if the coin is spent, true if it isn't.. ]
        return !coin.IsSpent();
    }
    // [ Return false if the coin isn't found... ]
    return false;
}
```

So it appears to be true for `CCoinsViewCache::GetCoin()`, but remember that a
`CCoinsViewCache` can be backed by another cache, or by a `CCoinsViewDB`, so
let's take a look at `CCoinsViewDB::GetCoin()`:

```cpp
bool CCoinsViewDB::GetCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin &coin) const {
    return m_db->Read(CoinEntry(&outpoint), coin);
}
```

OK! This is a little bit trickier, it seems a bit strange to me that
GetCoin doesn't explicitly check for spentness here, since I believe that
`GetCoin()` shouldn't exhibit different behavior depending on what sort of view
you have.

But this might make sense if we were *certain* that a spent coin will **never**
be present inside of the on-disk coinsdb, but it might sometimes be present for
a CCoinsViewCache for reasons that are presently mysterious, but for which we
don't care to call the coin succesfully *got*ten if it exists in another cache as
spent (all of which smells like a reorg situation to me).

In fact, from the comment describing `CCoinsView::GetCoin()`:
```cpp
/** Abstract view on the open txout dataset. */
class CCoinsView
{
public:
    /** Retrieve the Coin (unspent transaction output) for a given outpoint.
---> *  Returns true only when an unspent coin was found, which is returned in coin. <-------------
     *  When false is returned, coin's value is unspecified.
     */
    virtual bool GetCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin &coin) const;
// [...]
```

Can we be sure that `CCoinsViewDB` never writes a spent coin to disk? Let's take
a long look at `CCoinsViewDB::BatchWrite()`, which is how it handles having some
Coins flushed to it by a child cache: 
```cpp

bool CCoinsViewDB::BatchWrite(CoinsViewCacheCursor& cursor, const uint256 &hashBlock) {
    CDBBatch batch(*m_db);
    size_t count = 0;
    size_t changed = 0;
    assert(!hashBlock.IsNull());

    // [ This code block below comes from #10148 which introduced non-atomic
    //   flushes, relying on the blockchain itself to recover from crashes
    //   while flushing.
    //   https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10148/ ]
    uint256 old_tip = GetBestBlock();

    // [ Just below this if block, write before the writing BatchWrite starts,
    //   we erase DB_BEST_BLOCK, so if old_tip IsNull here, we were at
    //   Batchwrite before and something terrible happened, and now we're back
    //   again, replaying blocks to recover. ]
    if (old_tip.IsNull()) {
        // We may be in the middle of replaying.
        std::vector<uint256> old_heads = GetHeadBlocks();
        if (old_heads.size() == 2) {
            if (old_heads[0] != hashBlock) {
                LogPrintLevel(BCLog::COINDB, BCLog::Level::Error, "The coins database detected an inconsistent state, likely due to a previous crash or shutdown. You will need to restart bitcoind with the -reindex-chainstate or -reindex configuration option.\n");
            }
            assert(old_heads[0] == hashBlock);
            old_tip = old_heads[1];
        }
    }

    // In the first batch, mark the database as being in the middle of a
    // transition from old_tip to hashBlock.
    // A vector is used for future extensibility, as we may want to support
    // interrupting after partial writes from multiple independent reorgs.
    batch.Erase(DB_BEST_BLOCK);
    batch.Write(DB_HEAD_BLOCKS, Vector(hashBlock, old_tip));

    // [ Loop through the doubly-linked list of flagged CCooinsCacheEntry's. ]
    for (auto it{cursor.Begin()}; it != cursor.End();) {
        // [ If it's dirty...]
        if (it->second.IsDirty()) {
            // [ CoinEntry is just a special structure used for serialization
            //   of utxo with the DB_COIN prefix 'C'. Seems a bit overkill to
            //   need a whole object constructed just for that... ]
            CoinEntry entry(&it->first);

            // [ Erase and write below just add indivudual changes to the
            //   transaction batch, which doesn't get committed to disk until
            //   CDBWrapper::WriteBatch(batch) happens. ]

            // [ This is the moment of interest, if we encounter a spent coin,
            //   we send a command to erase it from the on-disk coinsdb ]
            if (it->second.coin.IsSpent())
                batch.Erase(entry);
            // [ If it's unspent, we learned of it, makes sense that it's dirty,
            //   flush it to the on-disk. ]
            else
                batch.Write(entry, it->second.coin);
            // [ keep track of how many changes we've made ] 
            changed++;
        }
        count++;

        // [ NextAndMaybeErase will delete the coin's CCacheEntry from our
        //   cache view if it was spent, it'll clear it's flags otherwise. ]
        it = cursor.NextAndMaybeErase(*it);

        // [ If the batch size is greater than some tuneable parameter, let's
        //   not go and let it get too big, we can do a partial flush here ]
        if (batch.SizeEstimate() > m_options.batch_write_bytes) {
            LogDebug(BCLog::COINDB, "Writing partial batch of %.2f MiB\n", batch.SizeEstimate() * (1.0 / 1048576.0));
            m_db->WriteBatch(batch);
            batch.Clear();
            if (m_options.simulate_crash_ratio) {
                static FastRandomContext rng;
                if (rng.randrange(m_options.simulate_crash_ratio) == 0) {
                    LogPrintf("Simulating a crash. Goodbye.\n");
                    _Exit(0);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // In the last batch, mark the database as consistent with hashBlock again.
    batch.Erase(DB_HEAD_BLOCKS);
    batch.Write(DB_BEST_BLOCK, hashBlock);

    bool ret = m_db->WriteBatch(batch);
    return ret;
}
```

2. In `CCoinsViewCache::AddCoin()`:

This is the inbound route for Coins that are flowing from blocks that we have
accepted and are connecting to our chainstate through `ConnectBlock()`.

```cpp
void CCoinsViewCache::AddCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin&& coin, bool possible_overwrite) {
    assert(!coin.IsSpent());
    if (coin.out.scriptPubKey.IsUnspendable()) return;
    CCoinsMap::iterator it;
    bool inserted;
    std::tie(it, inserted) = cacheCoins.emplace(std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(outpoint), std::tuple<>());
    bool fresh = false;
    if (!inserted) {
        cachedCoinsUsage -= it->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();
    }

    // [ AddCoin is called with possible_overwrite == true during block
    //   connection only if the outpoint already exists in this view's cache
    //   map. ]
    // [ If we got here, the coin has been freshly placed into our view, so it
    //   should have never been inserted before. ]
    if (!possible_overwrite) {
        // [ I feel that the if and throw block below is slightly misleading
        //   but not wrong, let me try to explain what's happening here as I
        //   understand it:
        //
        //   Reminder, a default constructed `Coin` like we should have now if
        //   we inserted above, is "spent". That's because we don't distinguish
        //   between an empty Coin, with all its CTxOut's members set to zero
        //   or null, and a spent coin. Coin::IsSpent()
        //
        //   If the coin is unspent, that means it's CTxOut is not blank. But, if we had
        //   succesfully inserted, because we didn't pass any arguments for
        //   Coin's construction in the emplace above, the Coin would be 'blank'/NULL/default-constructed/empty.
        //
        //   It seems worth noting that being freshly inserted is not the only
        //   way for the coin to be spent at this point, it might also be a
        //   coin this view already had as spent, even though no insertion
        //   happened. This is mentioned in the comment below about reorgs. ]
        if (!it->second.coin.IsSpent()) {
            throw std::logic_error("Attempted to overwrite an unspent coin (when possible_overwrite is false)");

        }
        // If the coin exists in this cache as a spent coin and is DIRTY, then
        // its spentness hasn't been flushed to the parent cache. We're
        // re-adding the coin to this cache now but we can't mark it as FRESH.
        // If we mark it FRESH and then spend it before the cache is flushed
        // we would remove it from this cache and would never flush spentness
        // to the parent cache.
        //
        // Re-adding a spent coin can happen in the case of a re-org (the coin
        // is 'spent' when the block adding it is disconnected and then
        // re-added when it is also added in a newly connected block).
        //
        // If the coin doesn't exist in the current cache, or is spent but not
        // DIRTY, then it can be marked FRESH.

        // [ If the coin is freshly inserted, it won't be dirty at this point
        //   since it has no flags. And we can mark it as fresh since the parent
        //   cache doesn't know about it yet.
        //
        //   Alternatively, if the coin already existed in this cache as a not
        //   DIRTY spent-coin, that means the parent view already knows about
        //   it.
        //
        //   These two possibilities at this point are *why* it's the case
        //   a FRESH coin is **either** known to the backing view as spent,
        //   or unknown to the backing view. ]
        fresh = !it->second.IsDirty();
    }
    it->second.coin = std::move(coin);
    it->second.AddFlags(CCoinsCacheEntry::DIRTY | (fresh ? CCoinsCacheEntry::FRESH : 0), *it, m_sentinel);
    cachedCoinsUsage += it->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();
}    
```
