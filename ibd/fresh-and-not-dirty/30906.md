# [#30906](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30906) refactor: prohibit direct flags access in CCoinsCacheEntry and remove invalid tests
_All code comments in `[]` are my own._

## Background

This refactor aims to simplify review of
[bitcoin/bitcoin#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673) which
removes logic for handling spent-and-FRESH-but-not-DIRTY entries that are in the
cache[^1]

It does so by refactoring some of the coins cache logic introduced in
[#28280](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280) which among other
changes, refactored `CoinsCacheEntry`'s flag setting and getting to be done via
an `AddFlags` method which takes a `uint8_t` of the set of flags being added
instead of the user directly modifying the `m_flags` parameter.

This takes that refactoring further and splits up `AddFlags()` into `SetDirty()` and
`SetFresh()`, since `FRESH` and `DIRTY` are the only two states currently
represented by flags for coins cache entries.

This is important for [#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673)
because invalid states being reintroduced will be possible as long as arbitrary
`flags` values can be passed into `CCoinsCacheEntry::AddFlags(uint8_t flags, ...)`.

## Solution

### [coins: Split up AddFlags to remove invalid states](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30906/commits/ab32309f0505d6138d4e75afe6063bfe16b6a533)

This commit makes `CCoinsCacheEntry::AddFlags()` a private function, and
otherwise does not modify it:

```cpp
struct CCoinsCacheEntry
{
private:
    //! Adding a flag also requires a self reference to the pair that contains
    //! this entry in the CCoinsCache map and a reference to the sentinel of the
    //! flagged pair linked list.
    inline void AddFlags(uint8_t flags, CoinsCachePair& self, CoinsCachePair& sentinel) noexcept
    {
        // [ Assume is NOP in release, assert() in debug builds. ]

        // [ We should always be adding either a dirty flag or a fresh flag. ]
        Assume(flags & (DIRTY | FRESH));
        // [ We are passed the CoinsCachePair present in the cache that refers
        //   to us, make sure that's the case. ]
        Assume(&self.second == this);

        // [ If no flags, have been set yet, we insert ourselves into the doubly
        //   linked list of flagged entries, right behind the sentinel. ]
        if (!m_flags) {
            // [ Our previous is the sentinel's old previous. ]
            m_prev = sentinel.second.m_prev;
            // [ Our next is the sentinel. ]
            m_next = &sentinel;
            // [ The sentinel's prev is us. ]
            sentinel.second.m_prev = &self;
            // [ Our previous's next is now us. ]
            m_prev->second.m_next = &self;
        }
        // [ Set the flags. ]
        m_flags |= flags;
    }
```

</details>

and replaces the public interface of `AddFlags()` with `SetDirty()` and 
`SetFresh()`, which both use the (now private) `AddFlags()` member function.

```cpp
struct CCoinsCacheEntry
{
public:
    inline void SetDirty(CoinsCachePair& self, CoinsCachePair& sentinel) noexcept
    {
        AddFlags(DIRTY, self, sentinel);
    }
    inline void SetFresh(CoinsCachePair& self, CoinsCachePair& sentinel) noexcept
    {
        AddFlags(FRESH, self, sentinel);
    }
}
```

and renames `CCoinsCacheEntry::ClearFlags()` to
`CCoinsCacheEntry::SetClean()` to better express that users of the interface are
not manually modifying flag values:

```diff
-    inline void ClearFlags() noexcept
+    inline void SetClean() noexcept
```

and makes changes all over the place to reflect this new interface:

From CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin() which sets a coin as FRESH if we tried to
retrieve it from the parent cache and had to fall back to the backing
cache, and the backing cache had the coin as spent. Whether or not this
particular condition is even possible is precisely what is discussed in 
[#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673).

From CCoinsViewCache:::AddCoin() which gets invoked during block
connection, we have discovered a new UTXO in the block and we are minting
it into our coinsdb, it comes into the in-memory representation first, so
(I assume that) *usually* this coin will be FRESH, except for in the case
of a reorg that has happened between flushes to disk, and a coin we know of
as spent and DIRTY is likely to be present as unspent in the backing view,
so if we mark it as FRESH, it's being spent would never get flushed to the
backing view.
