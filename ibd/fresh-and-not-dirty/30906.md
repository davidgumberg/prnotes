# [#30906](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30906) refactor: prohibit direct flags access in CCoinsCacheEntry and remove invalid tests
_All code comments in `[]` are my own._

## Background

This refactor aims to simplify review of
[bitcoin/bitcoin#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673) which
removes logic for handling spent-and-FRESH-but-not-DIRTY entries in the
cache[^1], which #30673 posits are not possible.

[#30906](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30906) does so by refactoring some of the coins cache logic introduced in
[#28280](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280) which among other
changes, refactored `CoinsCacheEntry`'s flag setting and getting to be done via
an `AddFlags` method which takes a `uint8_t` of the set of flags being added
instead of the user directly modifying the `m_flags` parameter.

This takes that refactoring further and splits up `AddFlags()` into `SetDirty()` and
`SetFresh()`, since `FRESH` and `DIRTY` are the only two states currently
represented by flags for coins cache entries.

This is important for [#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673)
because invalid states being reintroduced will be possible as long as arbitrary
`flags` values can be passed into `CCoinsCacheEntry::AddFlags(uint8_t flags, ...)`.

## Solution

### [coins: Split up AddFlags to remove invalid states](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30906/commits/ab32309f0505d6138d4e75afe6063bfe16b6a533)

This commit makes `CCoinsCacheEntry::AddFlags()` a private function, and
makes a few small changes to it, the old `AddFlags()`:

```cpp
struct CCoinsCacheEntry
{
// [...]
public:
    //! Adding a flag also requires a self reference to the pair that contains
    //! this entry in the CCoinsCache map an:d a reference to the sentinel of the
    //! flagged pair linked list.
    inline void AddFlags(uint8_t flags, CoinsCachePair& self, CoinsCachePair& sentinel) noexcept
    {
        Assume(&self.second == this);
        // [ If j
        if (!m_flags && flags) {
            m_prev = sentinel.second.m_prev;
            m_next = &sentinel;
            sentinel.second.m_prev = &self;
            m_prev->second.m_next = &self;
        }
        m_flags |= flags;
    }
// [...]
}
```

```cpp

```



otherwise does not modify it:

    inline void AddFlags(uint8_t flags, CoinsCachePair& self, CoinsCachePair& sentinel) noexcept
    {
        // [ Assume is NOP in release, assert() in debug builds. ]

        // [ We should always be adding either a dirty flag or a fresh flag. ]
        Assume(flags & (DIRTY | FRESH));
        // [ We are passed the CoinsCachePair present in the cache that refers
        //   to us, make sure that's the case. ]
        Assume(&self.second == this);

        // [ If no flags have been set yet, we insert ourselves into the doubly
        //   linked list of flagged entries, right behind the sentinel. ]
        if (!m_flags) {
            // [ Our previous is the sentinel's old previous. ]
            m_prev = sentinel.second.m_prev;
            // [ Our next is the sentinel. ]
            m_next = &sentinel;
            // [ The sentinel's prev is us. ]
            sentinel.second.m_prev = &self;
            // [ Our previous's next is now us. ]
            m_prev->second.m_next = &self;
        }
        // [ Set the flags. ]
        m_flags |= flags;
    }
```

and replaces the public interface of `AddFlags()` with `SetDirty()` and 
`SetFresh()`, which both use the (now private) `AddFlags()` member function.

```cpp
struct CCoinsCacheEntry
{
public:
    inline void SetDirty(CoinsCachePair& self, CoinsCachePair& sentinel) noexcept
    {
        AddFlags(DIRTY, self, sentinel);
    }
    inline void SetFresh(CoinsCachePair& self, CoinsCachePair& sentinel) noexcept
    {
        AddFlags(FRESH, self, sentinel);
    }
}
```

and renames `CCoinsCacheEntry::ClearFlags()` to
`CCoinsCacheEntry::SetClean()` to better express that users of the interface are
not manually modifying flag values:

```diff
-    inline void ClearFlags() noexcept
+    inline void SetClean() noexcept
```

and makes non-behavior changes all over the place to reflect this new interface:

There are no behavioral changes below, I'm just documenting why each of the
changed methods sets CoinsCacheEntry ~~flags~~ state.

From `CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin()` which sets a coin as FRESH if we tried to
retrieve it from the parent cache and had to fall back to the backing
cache, and the backing cache had the coin as spent. Whether or not this
particular condition is even possible is precisely what is discussed in 
[#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673).

From `CCoinsViewCache:::AddCoin()`, which gets invoked during block connection,
we have discovered a new UTXO in the block and we are minting it into our
coinsdb, it comes into the in-memory representation first, so mark it as DIRTY
always.

*Usually* this coin will be FRESH (our backing view does not know of it), except
for in a reorg that has happened between flushes to disk, where it is possible
that an unspent coin we are adding to the coinsdb is present in the backing view as
unspent, so only mark it as FRESH if the coin wasn't already present in this view
when we attempted to add it, or if it was present, it was spent and not dirty.

In `CCoinsViewCache::SpendCoin()`[^2] if the coin we are spending is FRESH we
can just drop it from the cache without worrying about informing the backing
view, but if it's not fresh, then the backing view probably has it as unspent,
so we need to flush spentness to the backing view, mark the spent coin as DIRTY.

In `BatchWrite` we are being flushed to by a view that we back. The principal
example of this is when we flush the in-memory `CCoinsViewCache` "dbcache" to
the on-disk `CCoinsViewDB` "coinsdb", we invoke the coins db's `BatchWrite()`.

Here, when `CCoinsViewCache::BatchWrite()` gets called, we have a
`CCoinsViewCache` being flushed to by a view that it backs.[^3]

While fresh data is being flushed into us by a child view, we still have to be
mindful of the state of the updated coins with respect to *our* parent view.

This block is handling Coins being flushed to us that we didn't have in our
cache (`CCoinsMap cacheCoins`). Every coin that gets written to us that we
didn't know about needs to be marked DIRTY since our parent does not know about
it either, and every Coin that was FRESH to our child (meaning we didn't know
about it) must also be FRESH to our parent. It seems to me that the check below
for whether or not it was `FRESH` in the child's entry is redundant according to
the supposition of [#30673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30673)

In this second block from `CCoinsViewCache::BatchWrite()`, we are dealing with
coins that are being flushed to us that we already knew about, most likely a
coin that we saw as unspent and the child is flushing that the coin is spent to
us, here we mark it as DIRTY, an if block above makes sure we never get here if
we knew about the coin and it was FRESH to us and gets spent:

`InsertCoinsMapEntry()` is a helper function for the coins test suite that takes
a `CCoinsMap` reference (`CCoinsMap` is an unordered map that is the core data
structure of `CCoinsViewCache`), a value, and a `char flags`[^4] and emplaces a
`CCoinsCacheEntry` based on that value and flags into the map and returns the
size of the emplaced coin. It is primarily used by `WriteCoinsViewEntry`
`CheckWriteCoins()`, which is meant to allow us to insert arbitrary values into
a contrived CCoinsMap that would come from a child view (which doesn't exist in
this instance), and then test that calling `CCoinsView::BatchWrite()` on the
parents coins view with the "child's" cache map modifies the coin view in the
way that we expect.

The flags on the coin we're inserting are not what we're testing here, but we
still need to set them on the coin according to the contrivance of the caller:

```diff
     SetCoinsValue(value, entry.coin);
     auto inserted = map.emplace(OUTPOINT, std::move(entry));
     assert(inserted.second);
-    inserted.first->second.AddFlags(flags, *inserted.first, sentinel);
+    if (flags & DIRTY) inserted.first->second.SetDirty(*inserted.first, sentinel);
+    if (flags & FRESH) inserted.first->second.SetFresh(*inserted.first, sentinel);
     return inserted.first->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();
 }
```

[^1]: According to the author of #30673, and other reviewers, this is not a
      possible state for cache entries to be in.

[^2]: `SpendCoin()` marks coins in the view as spent and happens during block
      connection by way of `UpdateCoins()`. `UpdateCoins()` is also responsible
      for adding freshly created outputs into the view (`AddCoins()`)

[^3]: At first I was confused by the fact this member function exists for cache
      views, but whenever we `Chainstate::ConnectTip()` or `DisconnectTip()`, we
      create a temporary `CCoinsViewCache` backed by the *real* full-fat
      "dbcache".

[^4]: *And* a reference to a sentinel `CoinsCachePair`, this ugly detail is
      necessary for maintaining the doubly linked list introduced in
      [#28280](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28280)
