## Background

`CCoinsView` and `CCoinsViewBacked` are base classes that are meant to be
overriden by descendants.

### `COutPoint` & `Coin`

A `COutPoint` consists of a txid `hash` and `vout` index. (`uint32_t`). 

A `Coin` is used to represent an unspent transaction output (utxo), its attributes are:
- `CTxOut out` which holds the `scriptPubKey` and `nValue` of a transaction
  output (txout).
- `unsigned int fCoinBase`: a boolean that represents whether or not
  the output's transaction was a coinbase.
- `uint32_t nHeight`: the height of the block this utxo was included in

When a `Coin` is spent, Coin::Clear() is called, which sets `fCoinbase = true`,
`nHeight = 0` and calls `out.SetNull()`. 

    `CTxOut::SetNull` sets `nValue = -1` and clears the scriptPubKey.
    Coin::IsSpent() just returns the result of `CTxOut::IsNull()`. (true if
    `nvalue == -1`

 `Coin` consists of a `CTxOut`


### `class CCoinsView`
This class provides an abstraction for working with a txout dataset. It is the 
base class of descendants `CCoinsViewBacked` and `CCoinsViewCache`

In theory, there could be a sequence of `CCoinsViewCache`'s that are backed by either another
`CCoinsViewCache` or an ultimate `CCoinsViewDB final : public CCoinsView` that
is backed by the on-disk 'chainstate' db.

In practice, the class 'CoinsViews' in `src/validation.h` establishes the
hierarchy used to manage the UTXO set. Starting from the bottom, a
CCoinsViewDB `m_dbview` facilitates access to the comprehensive on-disk LevelDB
utxo db. That is wrapped by a `CCoinsViewErrorCatcher`, which gracefully shuts
down when LevelDB errors occur, and at the top we have a CCoinsViewCache that is
our coin cache.

   ðŸ™‹Question: Why isn't database error handling built in to CCoinsViewDB?

### `class CCoinsViewBacked : public CCoinsView`

`CCoinsViewBacked` extends `CCoinView` with a protected attribute `CCoinsView
*base;` and a public setter method `void SetBackend(CCoinsView &viewIn)` to set
`base`. All of the virtual methods from `CCoinsView` are redeclared with the
`override` specifier and overriden to delegate to the backing CoinsView `base`'s
methods:

```cpp
CCoinsViewBacked::CCoinsViewBacked(CCoinsView *viewIn) : base(viewIn) { }
bool CCoinsViewBacked::GetCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin &coin) const { return base->GetCoin(outpoint, coin); }
bool CCoinsViewBacked::HaveCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint) const { return base->HaveCoin(outpoint); }
uint256 CCoinsViewBacked::GetBestBlock() const { return base->GetBestBlock(); }
std::vector<uint256> CCoinsViewBacked::GetHeadBlocks() const { return base->GetHeadBlocks(); }
void CCoinsViewBacked::SetBackend(CCoinsView &viewIn) { base = &viewIn; }
bool CCoinsViewBacked::BatchWrite(CCoinsMap &mapCoins, const uint256 &hashBlock, bool erase) { return base->BatchWrite(mapCoins, hashBlock, erase); }
std::unique_ptr<CCoinsViewCursor> CCoinsViewBacked::Cursor() const { return base->Cursor(); }
size_t CCoinsViewBacked::EstimateSize() const { return base->EstimateSize(); }
```

### `class CCoinsViewCache : public CCoinsViewBacked`

This class extends `CCoinsViewBacked` with the attribute `CCoinsMap cacheCoins`, which
is an unordered map from `COutPoint`'s to `CCoinsCacheEntry`'s.

##### `CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin`

```cpp
// [ Returns an iterator from the Cache's Coin Map of a given outpoint ]
CCoinsMap::iterator CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint) const {
    // [ std::unordered_map::find returns std::unordered_map::end if nothing is
    //   found ]
    CCoinsMap::iterator it = cacheCoins.find(outpoint);
    // [ If the outpoint is available in the cache, return the iterator to our
    //   cache entry ]
    if (it != cacheCoins.end())
        return it;

    // [ Otherwise we fall back onto the backing CCoinsView (in practice this
    //   will be the CCoinsViewErrorCatcher that wraps our CCoinsViewDB ]
    Coin tmp;

    // [ If the backing view can't get us the coin we want, return the `end`
    //   iterator to indicate failure ]
    if (!base->GetCoin(outpoint, tmp))
        return cacheCoins.end();
    CCoinsMap::iterator ret = cacheCoins.emplace(std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(outpoint), std::forward_as_tuple(std::move(tmp))).first;
    if (ret->second.coin.IsSpent()) {
        // The parent only has an empty entry for this outpoint; we can consider our
        // version as fresh.
        ret->second.flags = CCoinsCacheEntry::FRESH;
    }
    cachedCoinsUsage += ret->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();
    return ret;
}
```

### CCoinsCacheEntry

`CCoinsCacheEntry` is used for tracking the status of a coin "in one level of the
coins database caching hierarchy." Namely, whether or not that coin is spent or
unspent, `DIRTY` or `!DIRTY`, `FRESH` or `!FRESH`.

As described in the comments in `src/coins.h`:

`DIRTY`ness indicates that this cache entry is "potentially different from the
version in the parent cache", a `DIRTY` entry gets written on the next cache
flush.

`FRESH`ness indicates *either* "the parent cache does not have this coin" *or*
"it is a spent coin in the parent cache." `FRESH` coins can be spent without
being deleted from the parent cache on the next flush since the parent either 1)
does not know about the coin or 2) knows about the coin and knows that it is
spent. `coins.h` provides the following summary of the valid (5 out of 8)
possible states of these three indicators on a cache entry:

     Out of these 2^3 = 8 states, only some combinations are valid:
     - unspent, FRESH, DIRTY (e.g. a new coin created in the cache)
     - unspent, not FRESH, DIRTY (e.g. a coin changed in the cache during a reorg)
     - unspent, not FRESH, not DIRTY (e.g. an unspent coin fetched from the parent cache)
     - spent, FRESH, not DIRTY (e.g. a spent coin fetched from the parent cache)
     - spent, not FRESH, DIRTY (e.g. a coin is spent and spentness needs to be flushed to the parent)

Worth noting are the three invalid states:

- spent, not FRESH, not DIRTY - If a coin is not DIRTY, then our version does
  not differ from the parent cache, but if the parent cache sees a coin as spent
  then the coin is FRESH.
- unspent, FRESH, not DIRTY - If a coin is FRESH then the parent cache either
  does not know of it, or believes it to be spent. But since we know of it, AND
  believe it to be unspent, our version differs from the parent cache, so it
  shoult be DIRTY.
- spent, FRESH, DIRTY - I am less sure of this case. If the coin is FRESH then
  either our parent does not have it, or knows it as spent, and that seems fine.
  But why couldn't the coin be spent, our parent knows about it as spent, and
  DIRTY since something other than its spentness has changed?
